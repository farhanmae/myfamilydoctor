                                There are persons who do not want to confront a counselor face to face and also reveal in identity in public. There are persons who are not able to move alone or frequently but want constant or occasional consultation. Online consultations allow the user to consult a doctor while maintaining their privacy and without the hazard of travel. Online doctor consultations give them easy access to doctors and make it convenient for them to prioritise their health and privacy simultaneously. Online consultations are beneficial for people who want specialist doctor’s advice and second opinions on various health conditions

                                It’s technically legal. Earlier, there was a false rumour going about online consultation being illegal.
