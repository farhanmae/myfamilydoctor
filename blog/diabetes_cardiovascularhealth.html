                        <div class="entry-content">

                            <p>
                                Diabetes and heart disease often go hand in hand. We need to protect our heart with simple lifestyle changes that can also help you manage diabetes.Heart diseases are very common and serious. It is the leading killer of both men and women in the world. If you have diabetes, you are twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as a person without diabetes and at a younger age. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely it is to develop heart disease. However, the good news is that you can lower your risk of heart disease and improve your heart health by changing certain lifestyle habits. These changes will also help you better manage your diabetes. 
                            </p>
                            

                            <h4>How Diabetes will affect our heart?</h4>
                            <p>

                                 High blood sugar can damage the blood vessels and nerves that control your heart. People with diabetes are also more likely to have other conditions that increase their risk of heart disease:
                                High blood pressure increases the strength of the blood in the arteries and can damage the walls of the arteries. High blood pressure and diabetes can dramatically increase your risk of heart disease.
                                Too much LDL ("bad") cholesterol in the blood can plaque on the walls of damaged arteries.
                                It is believed that high triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood) and low HDL ("good") cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol contribute to hardening of the arteries.
                                Neither of these conditions has symptoms. Your doctor can monitor your blood pressure and do a simple blood test to see if you’re LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels are high.
                                These factors can also increase your risk of heart disease:
                                <ul class="ml-5">
                                     <li>Smoking</li>
                                     <li> Be overweight or obese.</li>
                                     <li>Getting too little physical activity</li>
                                     <li>Eat a diet high in saturated fat, Trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium (salt)</li>
                                       <li>   Drink too much alcohol</li>
                                 </ul>

                            </p>

                            
                            <p>

                                People with diabetes are also more likely to have heart failure. Heart failure is a serious illness, but that doesn't mean the heart has stopped beating, this means your heart cannot pump blood properly. This can cause swelling in your legs and a build-up of fluid in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe. Heart failure tends to get worse over time, but early diagnosis and treatment can help relieve symptoms and stop or delay the disease from getting worse.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Taking care of your heart and diabetes </h4>
                            <p>Strengthening your heart muscles is one of the best things you can do for your heart and thus make us healthy. And, as you know, the best way to strengthen your heart is through exercise. In fact, if you don't exercise, the chance of developing heart disease is twice as high as someone who does. If you have a history of heart disease or are just concerned about your heart health, you should develop a regular exercise routine. Our General Physician or practitioner recommends at least 120 minutes of moderate exercise per week. But are all exercises the same?Always,our family doctors recommend us some exercises which we can easily carry out in our day to day life in order to maintain a healthy life style for us. Here are the best exercises to help strengthen your heart. Let’s discuss some daily exercises that can be made as our part of life</p>


                            <h5>Walking</h5>
                            <p>Yeah, that might sound too easy. But walking, especially brisk walking is a great way to strengthen your core. Fast walking increases your heart rate and is easier on your joints than other sports. You can run anywhere, anytime. The mandatory item required is a pair of supportive shoes. Take a short walk on your lunch break or a longer walk on the weekend. You can listen to music, listen to a podcast, or go for a walk with a friend. The flexibility of walking allows anyone to do it and move on. Make it as a lifestyle and enjoy its benefits.</p>


                            <h5> Weight Training</h5>
                            <p>
                               The development of the other muscles in your body will help your heart. Weight training helps you build muscle mass and burn fat. While you can go to the gym to train with weights, some of the most effective strength training exercises happen when you use your own body weight. Things like pushups, squats, or even pull-ups help build muscle and support bone and heart health.


                            </p>


                            <h5>Swimming</h5>
                            <p>
                               Swimming is not only reserved for the summer afternoons. An aqua aerobics class or swimming can be a full body workout that strengthens not only your body but your heart as well. In contrast to other sports, swimming is gentle on the joints and allows you to move your body without great pain.
                            </p>


                            <h5>  Yoga</h5>
                            <p>
                                Even if it doesn't sound like it, yoga is great for your heart health. Yoga helps you strengthen and tone your muscles and refresh your body. Certain types of yoga can actually increase your heart rate while providing rest that lowers your blood pressure.Practising Yoga every day will make your body energetic and refreshed.
                            </p>


                            <h5>Interval Training</h5>
                            <p>
                                Interval training, alternating between short periods of high-intensity workouts and longer periods of active recovery, is a great way to get a full workout in a short amount of time. You can do this, for example, by running for a minute and walking for three minutes and then repeating the cycle. Raising and lowering your heart rate helps to burn calories and improve the functioning of your blood vessels.


                            </p>


                            <h5>Cycling</h5>
                            <p>
                                Jumping on the bike can do more than just move from one place to another. Cycling has been shown to help reduce your risk of heart disease. It uses the large muscles in the legs, which increases the heart rate. The positive part is that Cycling has even been shown to improve your mental health.
                            </p>


                            <h4>When to see your Physician  </h4>
                            <p>
                                The effective methods to treat heart failure is taking your medications, changing your diet properly, leading a healthy lifestyle, and meeting appointments with your General Physician. Your doctor will tell you how often to see them. However, if you have any unusual symptoms, don't wait until your next appointment to discuss them with your doctor. Call your Physician right away if:

                                 <ul class="ml-5">
                                     <li>You have a chest pain.</li>
                                     <li> Have a high blood pressure</li>
                                     <li>Feels shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations.</li>
                                     <li>You have diabetes.</li>
                                       <li>You have a history of high cholesterol.</li>
                                       <li>You have a family history of heart disease.</li>
                                       <li>You’re inactive and planning to start an exercise routine.</li>
                                 </ul>


                            </p>


                           
                            <p>
                                Whether you are practicing a yoga class three times a week, going for a walk with a friend, or swim every morning, regular exercise is essential to keep your heart safe. It is always better to consult your doctor before starting any exercise routine. Our best physician in Kochi, Dr.James Sebastian here mentioned some of the exercises which we can implement in our daily life. He points out the importance of exercise in our life and also specifies that routine health checkups are necessary for leading a healthy life too. The diabetic clinic situated in kochi by Dr.James Sebastian always stand for its patient friendly approach, and also gives us guidelines for leading a healthier life.
