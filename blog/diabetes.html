                            This blog is about the diabetes day - by Dr.James Sebastian - Diabetologist kalamassery.
                                Unhealthy lifestyle in today’s day and age has given rise to several diseases. And one of the major villains is diabetes.

                                Diabetes is the epidemic of the century with over 425 million people affected worldwide. It is a major cause of kidney failure, blindness, heart attacks, stroke, nerve damage and amputation. It also results in premature deaths and is one of the leading causes of the same.

                                Is diabetes curable? Watch this video to find out.

                            <h4>  Different Types of Diabetes</h4>
                            <b>  Juvenile Diabetes</b>
                            <p>
                                Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is a disease that lasts a lifetime, i.e., it is a chronic disease. In individuals with type 1 diabetes, pancreatic cells that make insulin are destroyed. This means that the body is unable to process glucose, due to the lack of insulin. And that results in too much glucose circulating through the bloodstream, which results in severe short-term and long-term problems.

                                Diabetes Mellitus (DM)

                                Type 2 diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus or non insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes, is the most common type of the disease. Of all the people diagnosed with diabetes, 91% have DM. It is a progressive and chronic medical condition. It lasts a lifetime and the symptoms increase in severity as the disease progresses.

                                Type 2 diabetes results in high levels of sugar in the blood. When the body stops responding to the effects of insulin or when enough insulin is not produced by the body, glucose metabolism is affected and its level increases in the bloodstream. This is known as hyperglycaemia. Over time, this leads to organ failure, etc.
                            </p>

                            <h4>  Prediabetes</h4>
                            <p>
                                Prediabetes occurs when your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but isn’t high enough to be type 2 diabetes. If left unchecked, it is likely to become type 2 diabetes within ten years.

                            </p>

                            <h4>  Gestational Diabetes</h4>

                            <p>
                                Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) develops during the pregnancy period when the pregnant woman’s blood glucose levels are higher than it should be. It is a condition that resolves itself once the woman gives birth. Click here to watch a video about GDM. Also, watch this adjoining video to alleviate your worries regarding diabetic pregnancy.

                            </p>

                            <h4> Symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                            <p>
                                There is a high chance of the disease going undetected for years as the early symptoms are easily dismissible.

                                Frequent urination, excessive thirst and hunger, weight loss, increase in infections (especially yeast and fungal), fatigue, blurry vision, dry mouth, slow-healing wounds, neuropathy or numb feeling in your extremities, etc. are some of the symptoms of diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes.

                                Risk factors of Diabetes Mellitus
                                One of the main risk factors that leads to diabetes is obesity or being overweight. There is also a high chance of type 2 diabetes if fat is stored mainly around your waist. Leading a sedentary lifestyle where most of the time is spent being inactive is yet another risk factor.

                                Genetics, family history, race and age are some of the other risk factors that can result in diabetes. Women having PCOS or gestational diabetes during pregnancy have a higher chance of getting diabetes.

                                Other risk factors include high blood pressure, history of heart attack or stroke, unhealthy diet patterns, depression, autoimmune disease, etc.

                                Abnormal triglyceride or cholesterol levels, smoking, use of steroids are also risk factors of DM.
                            </p>

                            <h4> Diagnosing Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                            <p>
                                Testing must be done for anyone having the symptoms of diabetes or is at risk for the disease. DM is diagnosed using the fasting blood sugar test or the A1c blood test (glycated haemoglobin test). In the former, your blood sugar is measured after you have fasted for 8 hours. The latter provides a snapshot of your blood glucose levels over the past three months.

                                Value less than 100 mg/dL is the normal fasting blood sugar. 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar level is equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL, you have diabetes.

                                Similarly, you have diabetes if your A1c test result is greater than 6.5 percent on two separate days.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                Complications of Diabetes Mellitus
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Diabetes mellitus can result in some long-term complications that are sometimes very serious.

                                Fat may build up on the artery walls leading to atherosclerosis. This impairs the blood flow to the organs and mainly affects the brain, heart and legs. High blood sugar affects vision as the retina is damaged (retinopathy).

                                Diabetes results in nerve damage or neuropathy, especially in the limbs. You may experience tingling, burning pain or numbness in the extremities. In men, it may cause erectile dysfunction. Elevated levels of glucose in the blood also cause kidney damage (nephropathy).

                                To learn about the various steps you can take to prevent diabetic complications, watch this short video.

                            <h4>Managing Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>
                                Making simple lifestyle changes is an effective way to manage diabetes. For many people having diabetes, their blood sugar levels can be restored to normal simply by losing excess weight, exercising regularly and by eating a healthy diet. For others, medication is required. And some may even have to take insulin.

                                It is of paramount importance that diabetics check their blood glucose levels at regular intervals.
                            </p>
                            <h4> Diabetes and Diet</h4>
                            <p>
                                Healthy eating is a vital component of managing diabetes. Simply changing your eating habits may sometimes be enough to control your blood sugar and curb the progression of the disease. Eating a healthy and balanced diet can also help you lose any excess weight.

                                For people with DM, carb counting is an important part of eating as intake of carbohydrates has to be limited. To keep blood sugar levels steady, try eating several small meals throughout the day. Make fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and lean protein a more prominent part of your new and healthy diabetic diet.
                            </p>
                            <h4> Living with Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>
                                Medication and lifestyle changes can help diabetics manage the disease and lead a normal life, free from complications. Though it is a complex and serious condition and requires diligent care, diabetes is not a death sentence.

                                It is of utmost importance that we all work together to help raise awareness and promote health education. Promote lifestyle changes that prevent the early onset of the disease. Also, promote the importance of regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet pattern that allows better management of DM.
