All adults need the seasonal vaccine every year. Walk into your best physician doctor in Kochi, communicate your need for immunization. Remember that a little prick today may save your life tomorrow.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                We tend to believe in the myth that adults are not susceptible to diseases; that they do
                                not fall ill. But common sense dictates that is not true. The older we get, the more
                                vulnerable we become. It is impossible to ignore the fact that ageing results in
                                decreased resistance power and immunity.


                            </p>

                            <h4>Why is immunization important in adults?</h4>
                            <p>
                                A large number of people seek expert medical care and are hospitalized every year.
                                Majority of these cases involve adults suffering from vaccine-preventable diseases. It is,
                                therefore, highly important to get vaccinated. It will surely help you stay healthy. It will
                                also help shield your family and community from diseases.
                                Wondering why you need vaccines as an adult when you’ve been immunized as a
                                child? Well, the answer to this question is multi-faceted.
                            </p>

                            <ul class="ml-5">
                                <li>
                                    The protection that childhood vaccinations offer wears off as time passes. So,
                                    additional doses of some of the vaccines have become exceedingly essential for
                                    your body to defend yourself against serious diseases.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Adults are at risk from certain infectious diseases like shingles. Hence, it is
                                    recommended that all adults get vaccinated.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a child, some of the newer vaccines may not have been available to you.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The germs responsible for viral infections change or mutate over time. For
                                    example, the influenza virus mutates as time goes by which means you need an
                                    updated vaccination.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Your job conditions, travel plans or health problems may put you at an increased
                                    risk for various diseases. Therefore, you need to get vaccinated.
                                    To learn more about vaccines, click here to watch a short video explaining the why and
                                    the when of vaccination in adults.
                                    Keep in mind – getting vaccinated is easy. It is a no-brainer. Walk into your doctor’s
                                    office today and communicate your need for immunization. Remember that a little prick
                                    today may save your life tomorrow.
                                </li>

                            <h4>What are the vaccines recommended for adults in India?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Several diseases prevalent among adults are preventable with the help of vaccines.
                                Without vaccines, you may not only get sick but, in some cases, you also risk death.
                                If you have an underlying condition like diabetes, discuss with your doctor about the
                                vaccines you may need. And always make sure that you stay up-to-date.
                                In India, it is recommended that adults receive immunization for influenza, pneumonia,
                                tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, hepatitis B, shingles, etc. A detailed list of
                                vaccinations is given below:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="ml-5">
                                <li>
                                    Tdap – 2 kinds of Tdap vaccines are available for those people older than 10
                                    years of age. Efficacy of this vaccine is 92%. It is recommended for all adults
                                    whose immunization status is not known and for those adults who haven’t
                                    received Tdap as a child.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Influenza – People with underlying conditions like asthma, heart disease, and
                                    diabetes should most definitely get flu shots every year. These people are more
                                    prone to serious flu complications, which may result in hospitalization and even
                                    death.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Pneumococcal – Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent severe
                                    pneumococcal disease. If you are infected, it is very likely that the disease will
                                    quickly take a turn for the worse and lead to death. Do bear in mind that not all
                                    infections can be prevented with this vaccine.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Hepatitis B – It is a serious disease in which the liver is attacked by a virus. It can
                                    result in scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), lifelong infection, liver failure, liver cancer,
                                    and death. To prevent infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV), it is recommended
                                    that people of all age groups get vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccination.
                                </li>

                                    Varicella (Chickenpox) – 2 kinds of vaccine for varicella virus is currently
                                    available in India. 2 doses are administered in an interval of 4 to 8 weeks. It is
                                    recommended that all adults (18 to 49-year-olds) susceptible to infection are
                                    vaccinated. It is especially important that the following people take the vaccine:
                                    healthcare workers, family contacts of immune-compromised persons, people at
                                    a high risk of exposure (example – teachers, international travellers, etc.)
                                    MMR – The Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine is administered subcutaneously
                                    into the upper arm. 2 doses are given at an interval of 4 weeks. It is suitable for
                                    adolescents and adults, especially women of childbearing age who aren’t
                                    pregnant.
                                </li>

                                    HPV – Papillomavirus infections are the precursors to cervical cancer. 2 kinds of
                                    HPV vaccines are available. The vaccine has to be delivered before exposure to

                                    the Human Papilloma Virus. Therefore, the person has to be immunized before
                                    their sexual debut. Age of initiation for vaccination is 10 to 12 years. Catch-up
                                    vaccination is advised up to the age of 26 and 45 years.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Herpes Zoster – Shingles is a painful rash that presents as an intense burning
                                    sensation. The risk of contracting diseases increases as you grow older.
                                    Acute infections make chronic problems worse. For example, if you have diabetes and
                                    get infected with the influenza virus, then it is highly likely that your immune system
                                    cannot ward off the infection. Developing an infection makes it harder for you to keep
                                    your blood sugar levels steady. This may lead to serious problems. It is, hence,
                                    recommended that diabetic people get vaccinated annually for flu. Another reason for
                                    this annual recommendation is due to the fact that viruses mutate and also immunity
                                    reduces.
