                                          This blog by a  best general physician in Kalamassery - Dr. James Sebastian discusses health coverage policies in India for everyone.
                                The pandemic has tossed our world upside down. It has wrecked the global health system and economy. The livelihood of countless people across the globe is in disarray. Based on a global survey by the WHO, 90% of families are struggling to access healthcare and medicine. Currently, half of the world’s population still do not have coverage of basic health services. About 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty as they have to pay out of their own pockets to avail basic health care facilities.

                                While this pandemic has resulted in unforeseeable setbacks, the health care system of countries around the world should seize this moment to take action and deliver free healthcare to all. To eradicate poverty and build a planet free of repression, the United Nations has embraced 17 sustainable development goals and one of them aims at providing Universal Health Coverage (or UHC).
                            </p>

                            <h4>   What is UHC and what is not UHC</h4>
                             <p>
                                Universal Health Coverage means everybody has the access to basic and quality health services they need, without facing any financial distress. It includes an entire range of quality health services from treatment to rehabilitation, prevention, and palliative care. The objective is to strengthen the health systems which undoubtedly ought to be more human-centred. Another objective of UHC is to assure that people get the affordable and curative health services they require.

                                There are quite a few things that do not come under the scope of UHC:
                                 <ul class="ml-5">
                                     <li>No country provides free of cost health services to people, UHC does not mean free coverage to all health interferences</li>
                                     <li>UHC comprises all the components of the health system such as the health workforce, information systems, health technologies and legislation and not just about health financing</li>
                                     <li>UHC, on the whole, is much more than health, it also involves taking steps towards equity, social enclosure, and growth priorities and so on</li>
                                     <li>UHC is not only about guaranteeing a minimum package of health services, but it also gives financial protection; hence there is an expansion of coverage of health services and more resources become available.</li>

                                 </ul>
                                 
                                 <h4>What are the Pros and Cons of UHC</h4>
                                  
                                  <p> By introducing health coverage, a lot of families can have access to basic health facilities. They do not have to pay from their pockets or savings. The overall cost of availing of the service will decrease. This will, in turn, help adjust the cost of medications, vaccinations and routine check-ups.

                                On the flip side, the doctors have less flexibility in negotiating the rate of their services. The second and more serious problem we will be facing is this – there would be a lot of demand from people to avail medical services and that would make it difficult to categorize patients with serious needs who have to be treated first. Therefore, there is a chance that the healthcare provided will be less tailored to meet individual necessities. Also, there would be an increased chance of mistake or malpractice.
                                   </p>

                              <h4>   What is ‘Universal Health Coverage Day’</h4>
                             
                               <p> Every country must invest in health systems to protect the well-being of its citizens and build a healthier future. Globally, every December 12th is celebrated as ‘Universal Health Coverage Day’ which calls for strong and equitable health systems. The theme for 2020 is ‘Health For All – Protect Everyone’. It aims to end the crisis and build a safer and healthier future.

                                One can be a part of the #ProtectEveryone virtual rally. It will stream live on the World Health Organisation’s official website. They will highlight the progress of all the countries, the challenges and the initiative’s taken up by the WHO along with its partners as a part of the UHC movement.
                            </p>


                            <h4>India and universal health coverage</h4>
                              <p>  
                                India is in dire need of UHC. Around 600 million people do not have access to healthcare facilities and 63 million Indians are living in poverty because of healthcare costs. This has a direct impact on the social and economic growth of the country. The root cause lies in the low level of public health spending. Concerning this, several reforms have been initiated by the Government of India. One such example is ‘Ayushman Bharat’ of 2018. It caters to providing free primary health care services through the various Health and Wellness Centres spread across the country.
                              </p><p>
                                Universal Health Coverage is a matter of paramount importance in developing countries like India because it would drastically improve health outcomes, increase life expectancy, lower the rate of child deaths, etc. Improving the access to effective health services would make people less susceptible to epidemics and pandemics.
                            </p><p>
                                On the other hand, UHC is a driving force of economic growth; it can generate a lot of jobs – from health care professionals and other staff in the medical industry to various other jobs in the pharmaceutical (or medicine manufacturing) industry.
                            </p><p>
                                To sum up: there are a lot of problems that the Indian Health sector grapples with. The challenge lies in what level of financial protection is considered apt. The national government trying to offer the same set of services to the entire population is not economically viable and would demand a high resource mobilization. The government should ensure that financial barriers should not stop access to basic health facilities.
                            </p><p>
                                On this UHC day, let us strive to ensure that everyone gets access to the health services that they need without having to suffer financial hardships. Our lives, livelihoods and futures depend on equitable healthcare. Let us not forget that Healthcare is a fundamental Human Right.
                                    From this blog Dr.James, the best general physician in Kalamassery gives us a clear picture of various health coverage policies in our country.
